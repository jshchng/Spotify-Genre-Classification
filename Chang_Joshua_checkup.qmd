# Spotify Dataset

I have obtained this Spotify dataset from \[Kaggle\](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/dataset-of-songs-in-spotify?resource=download) by Andrii Samoshyn. I will be exploring the relationships with the outcome variable 'genre' with the other predictors, the audio feature variables.

## Data Organization

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
tidymodels_prefer()

spotify <- read_csv("data/genres.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
skimr::skim(spotify)

ggplot(spotify, aes(genre)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal()

spotify_split <- initial_split(spotify, prop = 0.8, strata = genre)
spotify_train <- training(spotify_split)
spotify_test <- testing(spotify_split)
```

There does not appear any major problems with the dataset as this is a classification problem. The distribution shows the spread across the different genres; a boxplot/density plot was not possible here.

## Outline for Splitting Data

I will be performing an initial split with a proportion of 0.80, stratifying by my outcome variable genre. I will be stratifying when I split so that the distributions are similar for both the training and testing sets when I split the data.
